Question: Assume you're given a table containing information on Facebook user actions. 
Write a query to obtain number of monthly active users (MAUs) in July 2022, including the month in numerical format "1, 2, 3".

An active user is defined as a user who has performed actions such as 'sign-in', 'like', or 'comment' in both the current month and the previous month.

user_actionsExample Input:

user_id	event_id	event_type	event_date
445	7765	sign-in	05/31/2022 12:00:00
742	6458	sign-in	06/03/2022 12:00:00
445	3634	like	06/05/2022 12:00:00

648	3124	like	06/18/2022 12:00:00


Example Output for June 2022:

month	monthly_active_users
6	1

Query:

WITH july AS (
SELECT user_id as july_users FROM user_actions

--July 2022 user_ids
WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM event_date) = 7 and EXTRACT(YEAR FROM event_date) = 2022
),

june AS (
SELECT user_id as june_users FROM user_actions

--June 2022 user_ids
WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM event_date) = 6 and EXTRACT(YEAR FROM event_date) = 2022
)

SELECT 7 as month, COUNT (DISTINCT july.july_users) as monthly_active_users FROM july, june
WHERE july.july_users = june.june_users;
