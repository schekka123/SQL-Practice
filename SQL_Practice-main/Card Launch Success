Question: Your team at JPMorgan Chase is soon launching a new credit card. You are asked to estimate how many cards you'll issue in the first month.

Write a query that outputs the name of the credit card, and how many cards were issued in its launch month. 
The launch month is the earliest record in the monthly_cards_issued table for a given card. 
Order the results starting from the biggest issued amount.

monthly_cards_issued Example Input:
issue_month	issue_year	card_name	issued_amount
1	2021	Chase Sapphire Reserve	170000
2	2021	Chase Sapphire Reserve	175000
3	2021	Chase Sapphire Reserve	180000
3	2021	Chase Freedom Flex	65000
4	2021	Chase Freedom Flex	70000

Example Output:
card_name	issued_amount
Chase Sapphire Reserve	170000
Chase Freedom Flex	65000

Query:

WITH card_launch AS(
SELECT
card_name,
issued_amount,
MAKE_DATE(issue_year,issue_month,1) AS issue_date,
MIN(MAKE_DATE(issue_year,issue_month,1)) OVER(
PARTITION BY card_name) AS launch_date
FROM monthly_cards_issued
)

SELECT card_name, issued_amount FROM card_launch
WHERE issue_date = launch_date
ORDER BY issued_amount DESC;
