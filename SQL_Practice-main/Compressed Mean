Question: You're trying to find the mean number of items per order on Alibaba, 
rounded to 1 decimal place using tables which includes information on the count of items in each order (item_count table) and the 
corresponding number of orders for each item count (order_occurrences table).

items_per_order Example Input:

item_count	order_occurrences
1	500
2	1000
3	800
4	1000

Example Output:
mean
2.7

Explanation:

Total items = (1*500) + (2*1000) + (3*800) + (4*1000) = 8900
Total orders = 500 + 1000 + 800 + 1000 = 3300
Mean = 8900 / 3300 = 2.7

Query:

SELECT
ROUND(SUM((item_count::DECIMAL * order_occurrences))/SUM(order_occurrences),1) as mean
FROM items_per_order;
