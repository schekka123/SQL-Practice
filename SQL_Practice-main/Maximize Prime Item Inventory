Question: Amazon wants to maximize the number of items it can stock in a 500,000 square feet warehouse. 
It wants to stock as many prime items as possible, and afterwards use the remaining square footage to stock the most number of non-prime items.

Write a query to find the number of prime and non-prime items that can be stored in the 500,000 square feet warehouse. 
Output the item type with prime_eligible followed by not_prime and the maximum number of items that can be stocked.
Effective April 3rd 2023, we added some new assumptions to the question to provide additional clarity.

Assumptions:

Prime and non-prime items have to be stored in equal amounts, regardless of their size or square footage. This implies that prime items will be stored separately from non-prime items in their respective containers, but within each container, 
all items must be in the same amount.
Non-prime items must always be available in stock to meet customer demand, so the non-prime item count should never be zero.
Item count should be whole numbers (integers).

inventory Example Input:
item_id	item_type	item_category	square_footage
1374	prime_eligible	mini refrigerator	68.00
4245	not_prime	standing lamp	26.40
2452	prime_eligible	television	85.00
3255	not_prime	side table	22.60
1672	prime_eligible	laptop	8.50

Example Output:
item_type	item_count
prime_eligible	9285
not_prime	6


Query:

WITH prime AS(
SELECT item_type,
SUM(square_footage) AS total_square_footage,
COUNT(*) AS item_count
FROM inventory
GROUP BY item_type
),

prime_area AS(
SELECT item_type, 
total_square_footage,
FLOOR(500000/total_square_footage) AS prime_combination,
(FLOOR(500000/total_square_footage) * item_count) AS prime_count
FROM prime
WHERE item_type = 'prime_eligible'
),


non_prime_area AS(
SELECT item_type, 
total_square_footage,
FLOOR((500000-(SELECT FLOOR(500000/total_square_footage) * total_square_footage FROM prime_area)) / total_square_footage) * item_count
AS non_prime_count
FROM prime
WHERE item_type = 'not_prime'
)


SELECT item_type,
prime_count AS item_count FROM prime_area

UNION ALL

SELECT item_type,
non_prime_count AS item_count FROM non_prime_area;
