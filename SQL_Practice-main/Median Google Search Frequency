Question: Google's marketing team is making a Superbowl commercial and needs a simple statistic to put on their TV ad: the median number of searches a person made last year.

However, at Google scale, querying the 2 trillion searches is too costly. Luckily, you have access to the summary table which tells you the number of searches made last year and how many Google users fall into that bucket.

Write a query to report the median of searches made by a user. Round the median to one decimal point.

search_frequency Example Input:
searches	num_users
1	2
2	2
3	3
4	1

Example Output:
median
2.5

Explanation:
By expanding the search_frequency table, we get [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4] which has a median of 2.5 searches per user.


Query:

WITH frequency AS (
SELECT searches AS search_series
FROM search_frequency

--GENERATE_SERIES: Generates a series of numbers
--In below statement it would generate for each row like (1,2), (1,2), (1,2,3), (1)

GROUP BY searches, GENERATE_SERIES(1,num_users)
)

--SELECT search_series FROM frequency;

--PERCENTILE_CONT: TO calculate median. 
-- We use 0.5 as median is 50th percentile

SELECT ROUND(PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5)
WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY search_series)::DECIMAL, 1) AS median
FROM frequency;
