Question: Assume you're given tables with information on Snapchat users, including their ages and time spent sending and opening snaps.

Write a query to obtain a breakdown of the time spent sending vs. opening snaps as a percentage of total time spent on these activities grouped by age group. Round the percentage to 2 decimal places in the output.

activities Example Input

activity_id	user_id	activity_type	time_spent	activity_date
7274	123	open	4.50	06/22/2022 12:00:00
2425	123	send	3.50	06/22/2022 12:00:00
1413	456	send	5.67	06/23/2022 12:00:00
1414	789	chat	11.00	06/25/2022 12:00:00
2536	456	open	3.00	06/25/2022 12:00:00

Example Output

age_bucket	send_perc	open_perc
26-30	65.40	34.60
31-35	43.75	56.25


Query:

WITH snap_stats AS (
SELECT age_breakdown.age_bucket, 
SUM(CASE WHEN activities.activity_type = 'send' 
THEN activities.time_spent ELSE 0 END) AS send_time, 
SUM(CASE WHEN activities.activity_type = 'open'
THEN activities.time_spent ELSE 0 END) AS open_time,
SUM(activities.time_spent) AS total_time 
FROM activities
INNER JOIN age_breakdown ON activities.user_id = age_breakdown.user_id
WHERE activities.activity_type IN ('send', 'open')
GROUP BY age_breakdown.age_bucket
)

SELECT age_bucket, ROUND(100.0 * send_time/total_time, 2) AS send_perc, 
ROUND(100.0 * open_time/total_time, 2) AS open_perc FROM snap_stats;
