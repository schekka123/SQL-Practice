Question: A Microsoft Azure Supercloud customer is a company which buys at least 1 product from each product category.
Write a query to report the company ID which is a Supercloud customer.

customer_contracts Example Input:
customer_id	product_id	amount
1	1	1000
1	3	2000
1	5	1500
2	2	3000
2	6	2000

products Example Input:
product_id	product_category	product_name
1	Analytics	Azure Databricks
2	Analytics	Azure Stream Analytics
4	Containers	Azure Kubernetes Service
5	Containers	Azure Service Fabric
6	Compute	Virtual Machines
7	Compute	Azure Functions

Example Output:
customer_id
1

Explanation:
Customer 1 bought from Analytics, Containers, and Compute categories of Azure, and thus is a Supercloud customer. 
Customer 2 isn't a Supercloud customer, since they don't buy any container services from Azure.

Query:

WITH supercloud AS(
SELECT
customers.customer_id,
COUNT(DISTINCT products.product_category) AS unique_count
FROM customer_contracts AS customers
JOIN products ON customers.product_id = products.product_id
GROUP BY customers.customer_id
)

SELECT customer_id
FROM supercloud
WHERE unique_count = (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT product_category) FROM products)
ORDER BY customer_id;
