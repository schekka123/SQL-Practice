Question: Assume there are three Spotify tables: artists, songs, and global_song_rank, which contain information about the artists, songs, and music charts, respectively.

Write a query to find the top 5 artists whose songs appear most frequently in the Top 10 of the global_song_rank table.
Display the top 5 artist names in ascending order, along with their song appearance ranking.

Assumptions:

If two or more artists have the same number of song appearances, 
they should be assigned the same ranking, and the rank numbers should be continuous (i.e. 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5).

For instance, if both Ed Sheeran and Bad Bunny appear in the Top 10 five times, 
they should both be ranked 1st and the next artist should be ranked 2nd.

artists Example Input:

artist_id	artist_name
101	Ed Sheeran
120	Drake

songs Example Input:

song_id	artist_id
45202	101
19960	120

global_song_rank Example Input:

day	song_id	rank
1	45202	5
3	45202	2
1	19960	3
9	19960	15

Example Output:

artist_name	artist_rank
Ed Sheeran	1
Drake	2


Query:

WITH top_10 AS (

SELECT artists.artist_name,

DENSE_RANK() OVER(
ORDER BY COUNT(songs.song_id) DESC
) AS artist_rank
FROM artists

INNER JOIN songs ON artists.artist_id = songs.artist_id
INNER JOIN global_song_rank ON songs.song_id = global_song_rank.song_id
WHERE global_song_rank.rank <= 10
GROUP BY artists.artist_name
)

SELECT artist_name, artist_rank FROM top_10
WHERE artist_rank <=5;
